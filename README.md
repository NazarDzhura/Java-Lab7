# Java-Lab7

### My task was to:

1. Create a java console application and write a ___'Reftigerator'___ class
2. Additional 5 private categories that best describe this class
3. Methods for accessing these fields
4. Static field (numeric type)
5. Add 2 protected fields for class
6. The fields from 3,4 paragraphs must represent the attributes of the described class
7. Default constructor, constructor with 4 parameters and constructor with all fields. When working with constructors, you should use ___this___ to call one of the constructors and avoid copying code
8. Methods
* ___toString()___ - to print out information about the object
* Static method ___printStaticField()___ - to print out information about the value of a static field (where Field is the name of the field)
* The ___printField()___ - to display information about the value of the static field
* ___resetValues()___ ​​- to change the values ​​of all fields to those passed in the parameters
9. In the ___main()___ method, define 3 objects of created class (using different constructors) and print out information about them using the ___toString()___ method and print out information using the ___printStaticField()___ and ___printField()___ methods
10. The developed code must be pushed into the git repository! The repository must have a ___README___ and a ___.gitignore___ file.
